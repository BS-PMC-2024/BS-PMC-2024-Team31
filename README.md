# Testify AI

Testify AI is a website designed to cater to the needs of both students and workers in the realm of unit testing. For students, the platform serves as an educational resource, offering comprehensive lessons and hands-on practice to enhance their understanding of various unit test types. Workers, on the other hand, benefit from efficient tools that streamline the unit testing process, helping them save valuable time and increase productivity. The site is structured to support three main personas: administrators who oversee and manage the platform, students focused on learning, and workers aiming to optimize their testing workflows. Testify AI bridges the gap between learning and efficiency, making unit testing more effective and accessible for all users.
